# Notes on Project Implementation

During the development of this project, I placed a strong emphasis on **code quality, maintainability, and clear architecture**. However, due to time constraints, certain trade-offs were necessary to meet deadlines and deliver a working version.

I encourage you to **reach out with any questions or concerns** regarding the project. I am happy to discuss:

- The overall architecture and design decisions
- My implementation approach and rationale
- Potential improvements and optimizations for the future
- Any specific part of the code or system that requires clarification

My goal was to create a **scalable, modular, and maintainable codebase**, and I am open to walking you through my thought process and choices.
